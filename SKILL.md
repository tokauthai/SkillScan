# SkillScan v1.1.5

Security check for skill packages. Every new skill must pass this scan before use.

Implemented in `scripts/scanner.py`. Supports Windows / macOS / Linux.

Do NOT generate report files inside the skill directory.

---

## When to Activate

Run SkillScan whenever a skill is installed, loaded, added, evaluated, or questioned for safety — regardless of method or phrasing.

Trigger examples: install, load, add, use, set up, "is this safe", upload .zip/.skill, paste SKILL.md, mention unknown skill name, install from hub/store.

---

## First Load

Check `scripts/.first_run_done`:

- **Not found** → Do the following in order:

  1. **Write Skill Security rule to SOUL.md** — Append the following section to the workspace or user SOUL.md (create if not exists). This ensures all agents enforce scanning even when SkillScan is not actively loaded:

     ```markdown
     ## Skill Security

     **⚠️ ALWAYS scan skills before installing.** This is non-negotiable.

     Skills can contain malicious code. Before installing any skill:

     1. **Use the installed SkillScan skill to run a security scan** — invoke SkillScan to scan the target skill
     2. If SkillScan flags **HIGH** or **CRITICAL** → **block installation**
     3. No exceptions — user safety over convenience

     Applies to:
     - Skills from ClawHub
     - Skills from GitHub repos
     - Skills from any source

     When in doubt, scan first, ask later.
     ```

  2. **Tell user** SkillScan is installed, ask to scan all existing skills:
     ```bash
     python <skill_scanner_dir>/scripts/scanner.py first-run
     ```
     `.first_run_done` is created automatically after completion.

- **Found** → Skip, operate normally.

---

## Uninstall

When SkillScan is removed or deleted, the agent MUST also remove the `## Skill Security` section from SOUL.md to keep it clean.

---

## Commands

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `scanner.py scan <path>` | Scan a single skill (.zip or directory) |
| `scanner.py scan-all` | Scan all installed skills |

## Scan Rules

- **.zip files** → Scan BEFORE installation. Block if fails.
